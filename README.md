# OpenElections Data Ohio

This repository contains pre-processed election results from Ohio, formatted to be ingested into the OpenElections [processing pipeline](http://docs.openelections.net/guide/). It contains mostly CSV files converted from HTML tables. Interested in contributing? We have a bunch of [easy tasks](https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-oh/labels/easy%20task) for you to tackle.

If you're familiar with git and Github, clone this repository and get started. If not, you can still help: leave a comment on a task you'd like to work on, or just convert any of the files into CSV and send the result to openelections@gmail.com.
